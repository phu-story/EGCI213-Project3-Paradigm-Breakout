run by SHIT F6 or press RUN DIRECTLY with Main.java with neatbeans, I havent tested with custom compiler in VSCODE
got a problem with makefiles

This is almost done, but several things can be added

difficulty page, as discussed with Jet
customization page, customize background and color of paddles and balls
Improved pc movement, making it intentionally missed for example (have a plan, but not enough time
I think I can continue working on that tmr)
framerate and everything related to it can also be changed (required stats to be changed, just that, customization and stuff
33 makes the game too slow, when I  play, I feel as if Im on a speed)
minor gameplay improvement, such as, live system, 4 game modes as discussed with jet, let me explain

GAMEMODES

- sweaty            | comically fast ball speed, make it as a joke, for pros only, 1 life only (usually 3)
- atheletic         | smarter pc reaction, faster ball
- basic pong,       | just a basic gamemode, is basically what you are witnessing, 
    but with limited life function
- daddy can I play? | basic pong gamemode with unlimited life, the source code is in front of you rn
    dynamic speed IS DISABLED, bounce count cannot go up (you can disable it in code)
- multiplayer,      | WASD key ENEBALED, dynamic ball speed is also enabled, for two players

additional UI improvement required, and also customization, although is not classic, but if have time
would not kill if added

so far so good
sorry for typo, it's 1 am now and Im starting to hallucinate
